#Design Concepts

Wireframes Description<br>
My overall approach for this assignment is to create a bright and easy to read webpage that is also fun to look at. My idea for the design is of the sky around a skyscraper. The skyscraper would be positioned on the left side of the page with a blimp flying over the building with all of my content inside clouds. Then when the user hovers over the cloud of information, I plan to transform the cloud to where it expands with the content so it becomes easier to read. By doing this I think it will create an interactive feel and make it fun for people to scroll and browse; however, by keeping the clouds white and having them expand it wonâ€™t take away from people actually paying attention to the content itself. My hope is to make the user curious about all of the features on the website to where they will want scroll throughout the site. I want to make the website easy to read and playful so they are not just curious but are also enjoying themselves and like how elements on the page are transforming.  Having the large blimp up at the top and then clouds trailing down towards the bottom of the page will hopefully guide you to look at things in a specific order top to bottom rather than looking all over the page in a random order.
